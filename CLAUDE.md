# fhhos4

Fast HHO Solver for Research — solves diffusion (and biharmonic) PDEs with Hybrid
High-Order (HHO) and DG discretizations, with a focus on geometric/algebraic
multigrid solvers. Numerical experiments from related papers are reproduced via
`reproducibility/*.md`.

## Environment

Must activate the conda env before building or running anything (provides Eigen,
CGAL, GMSH, GTest, the compiler, cmake, make):

```bash
conda activate fhhos4
```

If the env doesn't exist yet: `conda env create -f conda/environment.yml`.

## Build

```bash
conda activate fhhos4
cd build          # or: mkdir build && cd build
cmake -G Ninja -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..
ninja
```

Produces `build/bin/fhhos4` (main solver) and `build/bin/fhhos4_tests` (GTest suite).
Clean build ~2.5 min. Ninja runs at most `MAX_COMPILE_JOBS` (default 2) compilations in
parallel: `Program.cpp` alone takes ~4 GB of RAM and ~2.5 min, and sets the build time.
With Make (`cmake ..` without `-G Ninja`), use `make -j2`.

CMake options (`-D<OPTION>=ON/OFF`):
- `ENABLE_2D`, `ENABLE_3D` (ON), `ENABLE_1D` (OFF): dimensions to compile.
- `ENABLE_DG`, `ENABLE_FEM` (OFF): DG and FEM programs (`-discr dg|fem`).
- `ENABLE_TESTS` (ON): build `fhhos4_tests`. Turning it off saves little time with Ninja
  (the tests compile in parallel with `Program.cpp`), more with Make.
- `ENABLE_GMSH`, `ENABLE_CGAL` (ON, CGAL is only used in 2D), `ENABLE_AGMG` (OFF).

## Test

From `build/`:

```bash
ctest --output-on-failure
```

85 tests, ~3.5 min (`ctest -E HPConfig` skips the 8 slowest, ~2 min). Most check the
iteration counts of the papers in `reproducibility/` — see `tests/README.md`. Covers
`Program_Diffusion_HHO` and `Program_BiHarmonic_HHO` (HHO, static condensation), 2D/3D,
in-house and GMSH meshes. Not covered: DG/FEM programs (disabled by default), `lu`/`cg`/`agmg`/`p_mg` solvers,
1D, anisotropic cases.

## Run

```bash
./bin/fhhos4 -h                # full CLI help
./bin/fhhos4 -geo square -mesh cart -mesher inhouse -s mg -cycle V,1,1 -k 0 -n 32
```

Example invocations for specific experiments/figures live in `reproducibility/*.md`
(one file per paper) and `tests/README.md` (one command per test case).

## Source layout (`src/`)

- `Program/` — top-level drivers per problem type (`Program_Diffusion_HHO/DG/FEM`,
  `Program_BiHarmonic_*`); `main.cpp` and `ProgramArguments*.h` are the CLI entry
  point and argument parsing/defaulting.
  `Program/Program_*.h` and `Program.h` only declare the programs: their definitions
  (`Program/Program_*_Impl.h`) are compiled once, in `Program.cpp`, with explicit
  instantiations per enabled dimension. Only include the light headers elsewhere (main,
  tests): including an `_Impl.h` recompiles the whole solver in that translation unit.
- `Mesher/` — mesh generation: `InHouse/` (structured meshes) and `GMSH/` binding,
  plus built-in geometries (Square, Cube, Square4quadrants).
- `Mesh/` — mesh data structures (Element, Face, Vertex, agglomeration).
- `Discretizations/` — `DG/`, `FEM/`, `HHO/` discretization schemes.
- `Solver/` — `Direct/`, `Krylov/`, `Multigrid/`, `FixedPoint/`, `BiHarmonic/`,
  plus `SolverFactory.h`.
- `FunctionalBasis/`, `QuadratureRules/`, `Geometry/` — numerics building blocks.
- `TestCases/` — analytic/benchmark problem definitions.
- `Utils/` — cross-cutting helpers (timers, export, types). Parallel loops are plain OpenMP
  (`#pragma omp parallel for`); `Parallelism.h` has the thread count and `ThreadLocal`/
  `ThreadLocalCoeffs` for per-thread results (e.g. the non-zeros of a matrix being assembled).

## Troubleshooting

- `cmake`/`make`/CGAL/Eigen not found → conda env not activated.
- GMP/MPFR not found → `conda install -n fhhos4 gmp mpfr`.
